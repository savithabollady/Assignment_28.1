• Hide All the rows where “attractiveness<6” by using grouping. Hide in the sense, we
should be able to see there is some rows there, which we can unfold to see. Also try
hiding the data without grouping.

-- Sort the sheet by attractiveness column, in ascending order
-- Group the row with attractiveness less than 6 by clicking on grouping

• Use the same data. The column named “attractiveness” is in general format. It is actually
a rating from 1 to 10. Can you prepend “C” before the number. i.e. if it is 1, it should be
converted to “C1”. Format the column to text type.
